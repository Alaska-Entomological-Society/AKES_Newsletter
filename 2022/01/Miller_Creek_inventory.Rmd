## Abstract

Because benthic macroinvertebrates and zooplankton are susceptible to the pesticide rotenone, surveys of freshwater macroinvertebrates were conducted in the Miller Creek Watershed, Kenai Peninsula, Alaska ahead of a planned rotenone treatment in fall 2021. Currently, 32 of 32 planned samples have been collected in 2021. Another 32 post-treatment invertebrate samples are planned in 2022 to enable comparison of pre- and post-treatment freshwater invertebrate communities.

## Introduction

Invasive northern pike (*Esox lucius* Linnaeus, 1758) were discovered in the Miller Creek watershed in 2019 [@KNWR2021] and a rotenone treatment to eradicate pike from the drainage was planned for fall 2021, parter of a larger effort to eradicate nothern pike from the Kenai Peninsula [@SANPCC2007].

Benthic macroinvertebrates and zooplankton are susceptible to rotenone [@Finlaysonetal2018], some of them dying at lower rotenone concentrations than fish [@Rach1988]. Planktonic crustations decline rapidly after rotenone treatments, generally taking months to years to fully recover [@Kiseretal1963; @Anderson1970]. In other southcentral Alaska lakes, most pre-treatment plankton species were present in lake water with in one to two years of treatment and plankton abundace returned to pre-treatment levels in the third year [@Chlupach1977]. On the Kenai Peninsula, most invertebrate taxa that were present in lakes before present were again present one year after treatment [@Massengill2014; @Massengill2017]. 

@Finlaysonetal2018 recommended sampling aquatic invertebrates before and after rotenone treatments to document survival and recovery of these animals.

Freshwater bioassessments have been based on morphological identfications, but metabarcoding has been found to be an efficient means of conducting freshwater biodiversity surveys [@Turunenetal2021].

For this paper we sought to

- document the pre-treatment aquatic invertebrate communities in the water bodies to be treated with rotenone as recommended by [@Finlaysonetal2018] and demonstrated by [@Massengill2014; @Massengill2017],
- test metabarcoding as a method for conducting this kind of routine inventory and monitoring, and
- compare the results of a metabarcoding analysis pipeline provided as a commercial service with the results of using a pipeline featuring Je [@Girardotetal2016], MetaWorks [@PorterHajibabaei2020], and local reference libraries.

## Methods

We began collecting a small number of invertebrate specimens in the Miller Creek watershed after northern pike and then elodea were discovered in the drainage. A small number of additional samples were collected in 2020.

A more thorough inventory effort began in 2021. We generally followed the methods used in previous aquatic inventories that were performed before and after rotenone applications on the Kenai Peninsula [@Massengill2014; @Massengill2017] with the exception that most identifications were to be obtained by metabarcoding instead of morphological identifications.

Aquatic mollusks were sampled under Alaska Department and Fish and Game Aquatic Resource Permit number SF2021-134 in 2021 and they will be sampled under permit number SF2022-122 in 2022.

The rotenone treatment of these three connected water bodies was completed on October 4&ndash;7, 2021.

### Study area

The waterbodies surveyed were those in which rotenone was applied, the same water bodies in which northern pike have been detected. These included North Vogel Lake, Vogel Lake, and Miller Creek. North Vogel Lake (14 ha) and Vogel Lake (49 ha) are separated by about 200 m and connected by a small stream that flows through a wetland. Both lakes are similar in terms of water quality metrics [@Meyer2021]. Miller Creek drains Vogel Lake, running approximately 7 km to Cook Inlet.

### Field sampling

We generally followed the methods of [@Massengill2014; @Massengill2017] for lake sampling aquatic invertebrates. Each of the three waterbodies was to be surveyed once in July and once in August. Sampling was to be conducted in the same temporal windows in 2021 and 2022.

At North Vogel Lake, Vogel Lake, and upper Miller Creek we sampled twice in 2021: first on July 20&ndash;23 and second on August 28. We sampled at 15 sites using three methods. We failed to make it out to the mouth of Miller Creek in July and August, so we collecting samples there on September 13, 2021. 

Sample sizes were chosen to be similar to those used by @Massengill2014 and @Massengill2017. @Massengill2014, to survey invertebrates in 38 ha Scout Lake, collected 3 light trap samples, 5 Ekman grab samples, 5 D-net samples, and 2 Wisconsin net samples. For 157 ha Stormy Lake, @Massengill2017 collected 5 Ekman grab samples, 5 D-net samples, and 3 Wisconsin net samples.

```{r nsamples}
ds <- read.csv("Miller_Creek_inventory_table_design.csv")
col.names <- gsub("\\.", " ", names(ds))
col.names <- gsub("D net", "D-net", col.names)
knitr::kable(ds, 
  longtable = TRUE, 
  booktabs = TRUE,
  col.names = col.names,
  caption = "Numbers of samples to be collected monthly in the three water bodies by sampling method."
)
```

At each of two visits per year we collected 3 D-net samples, 3 Ekman grab samples, and 2 Wisconsin net samples in Vogel Lake; 2 D-net samples, 2 Ekman grab samples, and 1 Wisconsin net sample in North Vogel Lake; and 3 D-net samples in Miller Creek, a total of 16 invertebrate samples per visit (Table \@ref(tab:nsamples)), 32 samples per year, and 64 samples over the two year project.

```{r millermap, fig.cap="Map of the Miller Creek watershed showing sample locations.", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/Miller_Creek_map.png')
```

In addition to the 32 samples per year intended to be processed by metabarcoding, invertebrates were collected opportunistically while the authors were working within the study area.

Field methods generally followed @Massengill2014 and @Massengill2017. We took vertical plankton tows in the deepest parts of the lakes using an Aquatic Research Instruments Wisconsin net (Figure \@ref(fig:nvw1)). We sampled littoral areas and streams with D-nets (Figure \@ref(fig:md3)). We obtained benthic samples using either an AMS Incorporated model 445.11 Ekman grab sampler (Figure \@ref(fig:nve1)) or an AMS Incorporated model 445.60 stainless steel Ponar grab sampler (Figure \@ref(fig:ve2)). Most benthic samples were sorted using a series of sieves.

We did not attempt to remove terrestrial species (e.g., non-aquatic flies caught in surface film) from aquatic samples; all invertebrates that ended up in aquatic samples were collected.

Field notes are available in @Bowser2022b.

Samples were collected into ethanol or SK picglobal 99.9% pure propylene glycol. Samples intended for metabarcoding were collected into propylene glycol or, in the case of two samples, collected into ethanol and then transferred to propylene glycol.

### Specimen processing

Specimens were deposited in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge's entomology and invertebrate collections (coden: KNWR) and managed with Arctos (https://arctos.database.museum/).

For the morphologically identified specimens, we used the following references: @Borroretal1989, @Brooks1957, @Burch1982, @Collet2008, @Durfee2005, @Haneyetal2013, @Hatch1953, @Herrington1962, @Kenner2009, @Mackie2007, @Marx1957, @MerrittCummins1996, @Merrittetal2008, @Reid1987, @Rileyetal2002, @Roughley2000, @Walker1953, @Wallis1933, and @White1983.

Notes on morphological identifications are available in @Artaiz2021, @Bowser2022b, and @Bowser2022d.

### Molecular methods

Metabarcoding samples were stored in a -23&deg;C freezer except when samples were being processed. Invertebrates were separated from debris by hand under a dissecting microscope. Care was taken to reduce possible cross-contamination of DNA among samples. Samples were shipped out on ice on September 29, 2021, arriving the next day at MR DNA (Shallowater, Texas, http://www.mrdnalab.com).

We chose to use the *mlCOIintF*/*jgHCO2198* (GGWACWGGWT GAACWGTWTA YCCYCC / TAIACYTCIG GRTGICCRAA RAAYCA) primer set of @Lerayetal2013 for PCR, targeting a 313 bp region of the COI DNA barcoding region. This primer set has been successfully used for a wide variety of invertebrates, including terrestrial invertebrates @Bowseretal2020, freshwater macroinvertebrates @Hajibabaeietal2019, freshwater plankton @Yangetal2017, and stomach contents of freshwater fish @BowserBowser2020.

The *mlCOIintF*/*jgHCO2198* primer pair was used with barcode on the forward primer in 30&ndash;35 PCR cycles using the HotStarTaq Plus Master Mix Kit (Qiagen, USA) under the following conditions: 94&deg;C for 3 minutes, followed by 30&ndash;35 cycles of 94&deg;C for 30s, 53&deg;C for 40 seconds and 72&deg;C for 1minute, after which a final elongation step at 72&deg;C for 5minutes was performed.  After amplification, PCR products were checked in 2% agarose gel to determine the success of amplification and the relative intensity of bands. Multiple samples were pooled together in equal proportions based on their molecular weight and DNA concentrations. Pooled samples were purified using calibrated Ampure XP beads. The pooled and purified PCR product was used to prepare an illumina DNA library. Sequencing was performed at MR DNA on a MiSeq following the manufacturer’s guidelines. 

### MR DNA analysis pipeline

Sequence data were processed by using MR DNA analysis pipeline (MR DNA, Shallowater, Texas).  In summary, sequences were joined, sequences < 150 bp were removed, and sequences with ambiguous base calls were removed. Sequences were quality filtered using a maximum expected error threshold of 1.0 and dereplicated. The dereplicated or unique sequences were denoised and chimeras were removed. Final zero-radius operational taxonomic units were taxonomically classified using BLASTn against a curated database derived from NCBI (<www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>).   

### Je + MetaWorks pipeline

We processed the raw sequence data on the USGS Yeti supercomputer [@USGSARC2021] using R, version 4.1.1 for manipulating data and Je, version 2.0.RC [@Girardotetal2016] for demultiplexing. The raw data included reads in alternating directions with the sample barcodes only on one read. Accordingly, we exectued the `je demultiplex` command, accepting the defaults that only require one of the two reads to contain a sample barcode.

Raw read data were processed using MetaWorks, version 1.9.5 [@PorterHajibabaei2020], running the default analysis options for metazoan COI DNA barcode sequences. Sequences were identified using the RDP classifier, version 2.13 [@Wangetal2007] and the CO1 Classifier, version 4.0.1 reference library [@Porter2017; @PorterHajibabaei2018]. 

We assembled a reference library by concatenating final Exact Sequence Variant (ESV) sequences from @Bowseretal2020 and @BowserBowser2020 and the DS-BOWSER project on BOLD^[https://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_SearchTerms?searchMenu=records&query=DS-BOWSER], then dereplicating them with `vsearch --derep_fulllength`. We looked for matches with this reference library using `vsearch --usearch_global`. We also compared our sequences to sequences available in BOLD using the bold package [@Chamberlain2021], version 1.2.0.

To further check identifications, we generataed a phylogenetic tree from our sequence variants using the [NGPhylogeny.fr](https://ngphylogeny.fr/) &ldquo;One Click&rdquo; fully automatic workflow [@CriscuoloGribaldo2010;
@DesperGascuel2002;
@Lefortetal2015;
@Lemoineetal2018;
@KatohStandley2013;
@JunierZdobnov2010] after removing highly divergent sequences with the odseq package [@Jimenez2021], version 1.22.0, running the `odqeq` command with an arguement of `threshold = 1.0`.

We processed data in R, versions 4.0.1 and 4.1.2 [@RCoreTeam2021] using the R packages ape, version 5.6-1 [@ParadisSchliep2019]; 
Biostrings, version 2.62.0 [@Pagesetal2021]; 
ggtree, version 3.2.1 [@Yuetal2017; @Yuetal2018; @Yu2020];
GISTools, version 0.7-4 [@BrunsdonChen2014];
msa, version 1.26.0 [@Bodenhoferetal2015]; 
openssl, version 1.4.6 [@Ooms2021]; 
reshape2, version 1.4.4 [@Wickham2007]; 
ritis, version 1.0.0 [@Chamberlain2021b];
sp, version 1.4-6 [@PebesmaBivand2005; @Bivandetal2013];
sf, version 1.0-6 [@Pebesma2018];
treeio, version 1.18.1 [@Wangetal2020]; 
uuid, version 1.0-3 [@UrbanekTso2021]; 
and zip, version 2.2.0 [@Csardietal2021]. 
We generated a circular plot using the circlize package, version 0.4.14 [@Guetal2014].

To the extent possible, scientific names used for the metabarcoding observations have been conformed to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System [@ITIS2021] because it is the *de facto* standard taxonomic database used by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service [e.g., @NRPC2014; @NRPC2019]. Specimen-based records used Arctos' taxonomy.

In order to exclude potential false positive detections as defined by @Mackenzieetal2002 and @Mackenzieetal2006 due to demultiplexing errors, we conservatively removed from the ESV table all occurrences that represented less than 0.05% of the total number of reads for any ESV, based on assuming a 0.01% to 0.03% rate of mis-assignment of reads @Deineretal2017. We also removed all occurrences represented by only one or two reads. 

After examining the resulting occurrence data, we believed that the rate of mis-assignment was higher based on unexpected occurrences of ESVs of *Chrysops excitans*, *Haliplus immaculicollis*, *Nemotaulius hostilis*, and *Limenphilus externus* in plankton samples. All of these ESVs were represented by large numbers of reads in D-net or dredge samples, making it likely that their presence in plankton samples was due to mis-assignment. Based on apparent mis-assignment rates of up to 0.36%, we conservatively removed all occurrences that represented less than 0.4% of the total number of reads or any ESV.  

As in @Massengill2014 and @Massengill2017, the metric used was simple presence or absence of taxa within the waterbodies before and after treatment.

We formatted occurrence records to be published to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, <https://www.gbif.org/>) following the guidance of @Anderssonetal2020.

## Results

Specimen data and images are available from an Arctos project (<https://arctos.database.museum/project/10003613>). Specimen records are available through a search for records from this project (<https://arctos.database.museum/SpecimenResults.cfm?project_id=10003613>). All Arctos records from this project are also published to the GBIF via the VertNet Integrated Publishing Toolkit (<http://ipt.vertnet.org/>).

Georeferenced photo observations have been gathered in a project on iNaturalist.org at <https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/miller-creek-invertebrate-inventory>.

A corresponding project record was also made on ServCat (<https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Reference/Profile/139305>). Raw metabarcoding data are available from ServCat (<https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Reference/Profile/139306>). Resulting occurrences have been published in @Bowseretal2022.

In the metazoan portion of the metabarcoding dataset provided by MR DNA, a total of 1,050,965 reads representing 2,250 ESVs were retained. After consolidating ESVs having identical identifications, 84 unique identifications were retained. The three most abundant identifications were *Gammarus kischineffensis* with 149,335 reads, *Glossiphonia complanata* with 69,285 reads, and *Enallagma* sp. bioug23416_h08 with 66,795 reads.

In the metabarcoding dataset resulting from the Je + MetaWorks pipeline, a total of 589,486 reads representing 277 ESVs were retained after filtering. After consolidating ESVs having identical identifications, 175 unique identifications were retained. The three most abundant identifications were *Gammarus lacustris* with 86,576 reads, *Enallagma* sp. BOLD:AAA2218 with 73,898 reads, and *Sphaerium nitidum* with 41,880. Read abundances of these and all other identifications are represented by circle sizes in Figure \@ref(fig:chordplot).

Twenty-two identifications (*Arcteonais lomondi*, *Bibio longipes*, *Caenis youngi*, *Ceratopsyche alhedra*, *Chaetogaster diastrophus*, *Daphnia longiremis*, *Daphnia mendotae*, *Draeculacephala angulifera*, *Haliplus immaculicollis*, *Holopedium gibberum*, *Isoperla petersoni*, *Libellula quadrimaculata*, *Limnephilus externus*, *Nemotaulius hostilis*, *Phryganea cinerea*, *Radix auricularia*, *Sisyra nigra*, *Spongilla lacustris*, *Tetragnatha extensa*, *Unionicola crassipes*, *Xenochironomus xenolabis*, and *Zapada cinctipes*) were shared by results of both analysis pipelines. The MR DNA pipeline consistently filtered out less reads than the Je + MetaWorks pipeline, but the overall results were mostly similar with generally the same or similar identifications for the most abundant taxa in terms of read counts (Table \@ref(tab:comptab)). 

```{r comptab}
comptab <- read.csv("Miller_Creek_comparison_table.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
col.names <- c("MD Identifications", "MD Read Counts", "JM Identifications", "JM Read Counts")
knitr::kable(comptab,

  col.names = col.names,
  caption = "Twenty most abundant identifications resulting from the two analysis pipelines. MD: MR DNA pipeline. JM: Je + MetaWorks pipeline.",
  format.args = list(big.mark = ",")
)
```


In the results of the Je + MetaWorks pipeline, Read counts and numbers of unique identifications were related to water body sizes and numbers of samples. In the largest water body, Vogel Lake, we observed 300,858 reads representing 112 unique identifications. In North Vogel Lake we observed 192,409 reads and 58 identifications. In Miller Creek we observed 96,219 reads and 28 identifications. The two lakes were most similar, sharing 21 identifications (19% of identifications from Vogel Lake and 36% of identifications from North Vogel Lake). Miller Creek shared only two identifications with Vogel Lake (1% of identifications from Vogel Lake and 7% of identifications from Miller Creek). North Vogel Lake and Miller Creek shared no common identifications.

## Discussion

### Identification remarks and new distribution records

```{r knwrrecords}
krec <- read.csv("Miller_Creek_new_KNWR_records.csv")
nrec <- nrow(krec)
krec$scientificName <- krec$scientificName[order(krec$scientificName)]
reclist <- paste(krec$scientificName[1:(nrow(krec)-1)], collapse = "; ")
reclist <- paste(reclist, krec$scientificName[nrow(krec)], sep = "; and ")
```

In the metagenomic data, we were not able to distinguish between species of *Enallagma* (Odonata: Coenagrionidae) because multiple species shared identical or nearly identical DNA barcode sequences in BIN [BOLD:AAA2218](https://boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BarcodeCluster?clusteruri=BOLD:AAA2218), which includes multiple Nearctic species [@Geigeretal2021]. These were likely *Enallagma annexum*, at least in part, because this species was identified in our morphological specimens.

The sequences identified as *Ephydatia* (Spongillina: Spongillidae) were 100% similar (*p*-dist) to sequences of *Ephydatia cooperensis* (Addis & Peterson 2005), but we refrained from using this name because this species is known only from Montana [@Mazzacano2008] and the COI sequences of *E. cooperensis* and the holarctic *Ephydatia fluviatilis* (Linnaeus, 1759) have been shown to differ by as little as one nucleotide [@AddisPeterson2005] or to be identical [@Meixneretal2007].

We documented `r nrec` new distribution records for the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge: `r reclist`. These were added the Refuge's species list in FWSpecies [@USFWSNRPC2019] the checklist data have been made available via a GitHub repository (<https://github.com/Kenai-NWR-bio/KenaiNWRspecies>).

The water mite *Huitfeldtia rectipes* and the chironomid midge *Psectrocladius simulans* have holarctic distributions [@Crowell1961; @Hayford2005; @Smithetal2011], but our observations in the Miller Creek watershed appear to be the first documentation of these species in Alaska.

### Comparison of the two analysis pipelines

Both analysis pipelines delivered comparable, acceptable results, but the identifications obtained in the Je + MetaWorks pipeline were likely more accurate. For example, the most abundant identification in both datasets was a scud identified as *Gammarus kischineffensis* by the MR DNA pipeline and as *Gammarus lacustris* by the Je + MetaWorks pipeline. Though our sequence is slightly more similar to sequences of *G. lacustris* than to sequences of *G. kischineffensis* currently available in public databases, sequences of the two species are more than 99% similar. However, *G. kischineffensis* is a Palearctic species not present near the Miller Creek watershed. Identifications like this were generally better in the Je + MetaWorks pipeline because we compared results of identifications using multiple methods and sequence libraries and we took the time to carefully scrutinize and edit the results.

### Methodological concerns

In all except the plankton samples, we generally observed less diversity in the metabarcoding results than we expected. We strongly suspect that this was due to subsampling of the bulk samples by the sequencing lab, resulting in some species not being included in DNA extractions. For example, one D-net sample that was photographed in the field (Figure \@ref(fig:md2)) included large dragonfly naiads and snails that were not detected. The sequences we received from this sample included 25,020 reads of the leech *Glossiphonia elegans* and 207 reads of the spider *Tetragnatha extensa*^[<https://www.gbif.org/dataset/9d7baaac-57db-4852-9993-7f0e7f15635b/event/2021-08-28-md2>]. In the future, we may homogenize samples using a blender and cleaning between samples using DIY-DS cleaning solution as described by @Buchneretal2021 before shipping samples out for metabarcoding.

```
Because of the large size differences between the invertebrates we collected (from > 20 mm snails and dragonfly nymphs down to minute, < 1 mm plankton), which can result in smaller species not being detected, we may sort specimens by size or take smaller tissue samples from large specimens when we resurvey in 2022. Both of these strategies that have been used to improve detection of small species in metagenomic samples [e.g., @Jietal2013; @Elbrechtetal2017; @Carewetal2018; @Elbrechtetal2020; @Buchneretal2021].

In future metagenomic analyses we may retain sequences from non-target taxonomic groups as recommended by @Zafeiropoulosetal2021. Why not?
