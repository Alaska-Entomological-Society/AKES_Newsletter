## Abstract

During the last decade three occurrence records for three
species of *Nicrophorus -- N. guttula,* from Sitka Alaska, USA*,* *N.
hebes* from Alaska, and *N. hybridus* from Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada --
were published, which are likely erroneous because no reliable evidence
suggests these species occur or occurred in these regions. This short
note provides details, comments, and species distribution modeling
analyses on these records and concludes all three are erroneous.
