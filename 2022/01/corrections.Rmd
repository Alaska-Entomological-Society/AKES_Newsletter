## Abstract

During the last decade three occurrence records for three species of *Nicrophorus*&mdash;*N. guttula,* from Sitka Alaska, USA*,* *N. hebes* from Alaska, and *N. hybridus* from Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada&mdash;were published, which are likely erroneous because no reliable evidence suggests these species occur or occurred in these regions. This short note provides details, comments, and species distribution modeling analyses on these records and concludes all three are erroneous.

## Introduction

Species of the genus *Nicrophorus*, commonly called
burying beetles in North America, are relatively well known,
large-bodied beetles [@AndersonPeck1985] now in the family
Staphylinidae [@Caietal2022]. Despite peer-reviewed publications
being the gold standard for reliable scientific information, errors do
make it into print and, when found, are best corrected. Herein, three
such records are addressed&mdash;while admitting the much greater
difficulty of demonstrating the absence, relative to the presence, of a
species from a region. One approach to this problem is to attempt to
answer the question of whether the climate of a region is suitable for a
species based on an understanding of the climate from where it is known
to occur. Thus, a niche modeling, aka species distribution modeling,
analysis was undertaken to help quantify the likelihood of two of these
questionable records.

## Methods

### Species Distribution Modeling

The basics of the protocols in @Oliver2021 and @Waraniak2018 were followed using the 19 bioclimatic variables available from the WorldClim 2.0 database which contain the averages for the years 1970&ndash;2000 at 2.5 minutes resolution (\~5 km) [@FickHijmans2017]. The bioclim [@Nix1986; Boothetal2014] model in the dismo 1.3-5 package [@Hijmansetal2021] for R v.4.0.2 [@RCoreTeam2020] was used with the presence-only occurrence data for *N. hybridus* and *N. guttula*. The R script for the *N. guttula* analysis is provided as an appendix. The occurrence data files for the R analyses presented herein are available at <https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19401131>. These data came from the collections and literature sources listed in Table \@ref(tab:collit). Those with DSS as the source are available in more complete form at <http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.mr221> from @SikesVenables2013. Those with GBIF as the source are listed below in the literature cited as @GBIF2022a and @GBIF2022c.

  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = "Collections and literature from which data used herein were derived."
)
```

## Results

### *Nicrophorus hebes* Kirby

Based on molecular, ecological, breeding trial, and morphological data, @Sikesetal2016 recognized this species as valid and elevated it to species status from a junior synonym under *Nicrophorus vespilloides* Herbst. *Nicrophorus hebes* is distrtibuted widely within eastern and central Canada and, to date, there is no evidence that *Nicrophorus hebes* occurs west of about 120° longitude or north of about 61° latitude in the Nearctic. It is thus absent from northwestern Canada and Alaska. Nevertheless, this species was accidentally reported from Alaska by @Meeds2021 who, while reviewing literature relevant to forensic entomology for Alaska, misunderstood the information presented in @Sikesetal2016.
