# Using the Sony RX10 iv for photographing insects

*by Bob Armstrong*

```{r sonyfront, fig.alt="A digital camera.", fig.cap="Sony RX10, front view."}
knitr::include_graphics('img/Sony_front.jpg')
```

```{r sonyrear, fig.alt="A digital camera.", fig.cap="Sony RX10, back view."}
knitr::include_graphics('img/Sony_rear.jpg')
```

I have been testing a Sony RX10 iv (Figures \@ref(fig:sonyfront)&ndash\@ref(fig:sonyrear)) for insect photography and so far:

1. This may be the best camera for photographing insects both in the wild and in the lab.

2. It focuses very quickly on insects in nature from a few feet away. This allows you to photograph them without any disturbance.

3. With the addition of a Raynox Super Macro snap on lens you can photograph very tiny insects.

4. The built in flash works very well. This allows you to use a high f-stop, up to f/16, and a high shutter speed (1/1,000 of a second). This gives you a high depth of field and best of all you can hand hold the camera and not have to use a tripod or external flash.

5. In the lab the viewing screen moves for perfect viewing. The camera has a high depth of field, the built in flash works well, and there is no need to use a camera attached to a microscope.
