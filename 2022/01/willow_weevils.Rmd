# Willow Weevils in Juneau, Alaska

We often see adult willow weevils crawling on the snow in March and early April (Figure \@ref(fig:weevilsnow)). Derek Sikes of the University of Alaska Museum of the North identified photographs of specimens as *Dorytomus*. Of the 252 records of Dorytomus in Alaska, *D. leucophyllus* is the only species that has been found in Juneau.

On April 11, 2021 we visited a willow area at the end of Industrial Boulevard  in Juneau (Figure \@ref(fig:Indwillow)). We shook one of the trees and several adult weevils fell on the snow beneath the tree. A few of these adults were placed in a terrarium and kept indoors. Within a few hours we observed four couples mating (\@ref(fig:weevilsmating)). It appeared that the weevils were on the tree for the purpose of mating.
