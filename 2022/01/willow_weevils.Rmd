# Willow Weevils in Juneau, Alaska

We often see adult willow weevils crawling on the snow in March and early April (Figure \@ref(fig:weevilsnow)). Derek Sikes of the University of Alaska Museum of the North identified photographs of specimens as *Dorytomus*. Of the 252 records of Dorytomus in Alaska, *D. leucophyllus* is the only species that has been found in Juneau.

On April 11, 2021 we visited a willow area at the end of Industrial Boulevard  in Juneau (Figure \@ref(fig:Indwillow)). We shook one of the trees and several adult weevils fell on the snow beneath the tree. A few of these adults were placed in a terrarium and kept indoors. Within a few hours we observed four couples mating (\@ref(fig:weevilsmating)). It appeared that the weevils were on the tree for the purpose of mating.

```{r weevilsmating, fig.alt="Two mating weevils.", fig.cap="Willow weevils mating in a terrarium."}
knitr::include_graphics('img/willow_weevils_03.jpg')
```

After mating the female lays an egg on the catkin (Figure \@ref(fig:femoncatkin)). We never found more than one larva inside the catkins that were examined (Figure \@ref(fig:larva)). This indicates the weevil may only lay one egg per catkin.

```{r femoncatkin, fig.alt="A weevil on a willow catkin.", fig.cap="A female willow weevil on a willow catkin."}

```{r larva, fig.alt="A weevil larva in willow catkin.", fig.cap="A weevil larva inside a dissected catkin."}
knitr::include_graphics('img/willow_weevils_05.jpg')
```

Catkins containing willow larvae are usually bent (Figure \@ref(fig:bentcatkin)). A cavity with brown edges inside the catkin indicates where the larva has been feeding.
 
```{r bentcatkin, fig.alt="A willow catkin cut in half to show a chamber where the weevil larva has been feeding inside the catkin.", fig.cap="A willow catkin dissected to show the cavity in which a weevil has been feeding."}
