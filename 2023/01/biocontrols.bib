	abstract = {The principal insects that attack toadflax (
              Linaria vulgaris
              Mill.) in Canada are
              Brachypterolus pulicarius
              (L.), a flower-eating nitidulid, and
              Gymnaetron antirrhini
              (Payk.), a seed-eating weevil.
              B. pulicarius
              was found in 1953 in all provinces of Canada but
              G. antirrhini
              was apparently absent from Saskatchewan and Alberta, the two provinces where the spread of toadflax was causing alarm. Thus the seriousness of the toadflax seemed to be related to the absence of
              G. antirrhini
              . In an artempt to correct this situation Smith (1959) collected 4,000 adult
              G. antirrhini
              and released them in mid-July, 1957, at Marsden, Saskatchewan, and Codesa, Alberta. However, it now appears that the rapid spread of toadflax occurred in the absence of
              B. pulicarius
              and that this beetle is more valuable than first thought. This paper discusses the role of
              B. pulicarius
              and the results of introducing
              G. antirrhini

	abstract = {Yellow toadflax, Linaria vulgaris Mill. (Scrophulariaceae), is a weed of rangelands and agricultural crops. Introduced from Eurasia into North America more than 300 yr ago, it is now naturalized in all provinces and territories up to 60° northern latitude and beyond 2000 m altitude. It became a concern in the middle of this century when it invaded the prairies. Its seriousness as a weed declined in the late 1950s, possibly as a result of biological control. Concern has been renewed recently because the adoption of minimum tillage techniques could lead to greater abundance. Reproduction is vigourous by means of adventitious root buds and by high seed production. Growth forms, vegetative reproduction, flower phenology, and germination are variable. The capability for regrowth from root parts makes L. vulgaris a difficult weed to eradicate and limits the efficacy of cultural control methods. The possibilities for chemical control are limited due to resistance to common herbicides. Biological control projects conducted during the past 50 yr have been partly successful and are on-going.
