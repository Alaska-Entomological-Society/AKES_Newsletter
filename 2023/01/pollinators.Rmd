# Metabarcoding pollinators on Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, Kenai Peninsula, Alaska

*by Matt Bowser^[USFWS Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, Soldotna, Alaska, matt_bowser@fws.gov], Anya Bronowski, and Dom Watts^[USFWS Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, Soldotna, Alaska]*

## Introduction

Pollinating insects provide important ecosystem services in Alaska [@Fulkersonetal2021] and the pollinators themselves are wildlife that the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge (KNWR or the Refuge) was established in part to conserve [@KenaiNWR2010CCP].  Because pollinators appear to be generally declining [@Pottsetal2010; @Cameronetal2011; @Kohetal2016], we wanted to begin documenting pollinator diversity on the Refuge.

The Alaska Bee Atlas [@Fulkersonetal2021, <https://accs.uaa.alaska.edu/wildlife/ak-bee-atlas>] is a sampling program designed to provide information on the biodiveristy of pollinators in Alaska. In 2022, KNWR biologists participated in the Alaska Bee Atlas effort.

## Methods

### Sampling Design

We followed the guidance of the sampling plan of @Fulkersonetal2021. Most of KNWR lies within lowest priority hexagons of @Fulkersonetal2021, but the southernmost part of the Refuge lies within a medium priority hexagon. We prioritized sampling in this area, but access in this region is difficult. We surveyed only at Emerald Lake in this medium priority hexagon.

We surveyed for insect pollinators at a variety of other sites on the Refuge, trying to sample in diverse habitats. We sampled dry, rocky slopes off of Skilak Lake Road following the advice of Justin Fulkerson.

We accessed sites by road and floatplane.

### Field Methods

We sampled pollinators using bee bowl traps (Figure \@ref(fig:pollinatorsbowl)), blue vane traps (Figure \@ref(fig:pollinatorsBVT)), and aerial nets (Figure \@ref(fig:pollinatorsTwin)), generally following the field methods of @Fulkersonetal2021 with the exception that we collected specimens into SK picglobal 99.9% pure propylene glycol.

### Specimen Processing

### Bioinformatics

The bioinformatics pipeline was run on the Yeti supercomputer [@USGSARC2021]. We used the MetaWorks pipeline, version 1.11.3 [@PorterHajibabaei2022] with the RDP classifier [@Wangetal2007] and the Eukaryote CO1 reference set for the RDP Classifier, version 4.0.1 [@PorterHajibabaei2018]. We processed data in R, version 4.2.2 [@RCoreTeam2022] using the R packages bold, version 1.2.0 [@Chamberlain2021] and reshape2 package, version 1.4.4 [@Wickham2007]. We compared our sequences to sequences from a local reference library [@Bowser2022COIlib] using the `vsearch --usearch_global` command of vsearch, version 2.21.1 [@Rognesetal2016].

## Results

Project data and project photos are available on Arctos via an Arctos project record (<https://arctos.database.museum/project/10003917>), and specimen records can be viewed via an Arctos search^[<https://arctos.database.museum/search.cfm?project_id=10003917&collection_id=46>].  Project information is also available from a project record on ServCat (<https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Reference/Profile/148742>). Raw sequence data from this project are available from @Bowser2022pollinatorraw.
