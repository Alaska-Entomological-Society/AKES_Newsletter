# Metabarcoding pollinators on Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, Kenai Peninsula, Alaska

*by Matt Bowser^[USFWS Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, Soldotna, Alaska, matt_bowser@fws.gov], Anya Bronowski, and Dom Watts^[USFWS Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, Soldotna, Alaska]*

## Introduction

Pollinating insects provide important ecosystem services in Alaska [@Fulkersonetal2021] and the pollinators themselves are wildlife that the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge (KNWR or the Refuge) was established in part to conserve [@KenaiNWR2010CCP].  Because pollinators appear to be generally declining [@Pottsetal2010; @Cameronetal2011; @Kohetal2016], we wanted to begin documenting pollinator diversity on the Refuge.

The Alaska Bee Atlas [@Fulkersonetal2021, <https://accs.uaa.alaska.edu/wildlife/ak-bee-atlas>] is a sampling program designed to provide information on the biodiveristy of pollinators in Alaska. In 2022, KNWR biologists participated in the Alaska Bee Atlas effort.

## Methods

### Field Methods

We generally followed the field methods of @Fulkersonetal2021 with the exception that we collected specimens into SK picglobal 99.9% pure propylene glycol.

```

### Specimen Processing

### Bioinformatics

The bioinformatics pipeline was run on the Yeti supercomputer [@USGSARC2021]. We used the MetaWorks pipeline, version 1.11.3 [@PorterHajibabaei2022] with the RDP classifier [@Wangetal2007] and the Eukaryote CO1 Reference Set For The RDP Classifier, version 4.0.1 [@PorterHajibabaei2018]. We processed data in R, version 4.2.2 [@RCoreTeam2022] using the R packages bold, version 1.2.0 [@Chamberlain2021] and reshape2 package, version 1.4.4 [@Wickham2007].

## Results

Raw sequence data from this project are available from @Bowser2022pollinatorraw.
