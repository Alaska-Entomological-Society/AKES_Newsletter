\section{Introduction}

Last year we  wrote about some food items of the Alaska blackfish, \textit{Dallia pectoralis} T.\ H.\ Bean, 1880 \citep{Bowseretal2019},  a fish species that is native to part of Alaska, but not the Kenai Peninsula. We wanted to learn more about how these introduced fish may alter the ecology of Kenai Peninsula waters, especially how blackfish may affect native fish species through competition for invertebrate prey.

\section{Methods}

On August 23, 2019, the first author collected blackfish from a small, shallow pond in Kenai, Alaska (60.5681~\textdegree{}N, -151.1901~\textdegree{}W $\pm$ 40~m) \citep{bowser2019}, the same pond from which we had obtained blackfish the previous year. This pond is fed by a small inlet stream and its level is maintained by a dam at the outlet. There is little open water; most of the pond is thickly filled with \textit{Potamogeton} and flocculent iron bacterial scum. Only one other fish species, a single specimen of a nine-spined stickleback (\textit{Pungitius pungitius} (Linnaeus, 1758),  
\url{https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/31561030}), was observed in this pond.

The first author attempted to collect blackfish from other reaches of the stream, but found only small juveniles. 

The collected blackfish were placed on ice in a cooler, transported to the lab, and frozen. Later we thawed five adult blackfish, measured their lengths, dissected out their entire guts, and squeezed gut contents into vials of \acr{RV} antifreeze.% What kind?

Specimen data and associated images have been made available via an Arctos project at \url{http://arctos.database.museum/project/10003367}.

\section{Results}

\section{Discussion}

It was surprising that we detected none of the food items documented by \citet{Bowseretal2019}.
