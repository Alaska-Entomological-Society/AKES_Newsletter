Survival of second instar larvae was significantly greater on diets containing a high proportion of pollen and nectar or live bee prepupae than on the other diets tested. Head-capsule growth approximately followed Dyar's rule, but a logarithmic relationship more accurately described growth. The number of larval instars was either 5 or 6. A logarithmic relationship described the developmental pattern of the instars more accurately than did linear or second degree polynomial equations.},
