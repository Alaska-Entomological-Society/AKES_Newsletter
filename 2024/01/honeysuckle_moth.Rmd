# Defoliation of haskap shoots by the honeysuckle moth in Southcentral Alaska

*by Alexandria Wenninger*^[University of Alaska Fairbanks Cooperative Extension Service Integrated Pest Management Program, akwenninger@alaska.edu]

The honeysuckle moth (*Ypsolopha dentella* (Fabricius, 1775)) has been identified as a defoliator of developing shoots on haskap (aka ‘honeyberry’ or ‘blue honeysuckle’, *Lonicera caerulea* Linnaeus) in Southcentral Alaska. Haskap is a cold-hardy ornamental shrub that is grown for its edible berries in Alaska, however little information is available regarding insect pests of haskap in North America. Several instances of shoot defoliation on haskaps and ornamental honeysuckles were reported from Anchorage and the Matanuska-Susitna Valley in late May and early June of 2022 leading to an investigation into the identity and life history of this non-native defoliator (Figure \@ref(fig:honeysuckledamage)).

## Honeysuckle Moth Life History

Honeysuckle moth caterpillars were found feeding on host plants late May through mid-June in both Anchorage and the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. Early instar caterpillars feed within developing leaf shoots, producing silk which keeps the developing leaves loosely clasped together into a retreat, protecting the feeding caterpillars (Figure \@ref(fig:honeysucklefeeding)). The early instar caterpillars are pale yellowish in color with green longitudinal stripes down the dorsum and many long, dark setae speckling their abdomens. Later instar caterpillars develop a wide, reddish stripe down the dorsum, which appears to mimic the two-toned coloration of haskap and ornamental honeysuckle stems (Figure \@ref(fig:honeysuckledamage)). The caterpillars display notable quick and erratic “wiggling” movements when disturbed, and upon reaching the edge of the leaf may leap from the host plant by a silken thread affixed to their retreat in a process other authors have named “bungee-jumping” [@Eisneretal2005]; soon after making the leap they return to the retreat by pulling themselves up by their mouthparts, folding the silken thread as they go. Pupation occurs within a spindle-shaped silken covering on or near the host plant. Adults at rest are ~12 mm long and appear reddish brown laterally with a pale dorsal band that makes a ventral turn posteriorly; when viewed laterally the posterior end appears upturned (“apically falcate”) and the face features a brush of setae projected forward (Figure \@ref(fig:honeysuckleadult)). Adults have been observed in Anchorage from early July through August (University of Alaska Museum records accessed 6 June 2022 via Arctos and iNaturalist records accessed 15 July 2022). Information about the overwintering of this species is scarce, but it is thought that eggs are laid on the host plant in late summer and the species overwinters as an egg [@Wall2005; @Montgomeryshiremothgroup2009].

## Hosts

The honeysuckle moth is known to feed on members of the honeysuckle genus (*Lonicera* spp.). This defoliator is of particular interest due to its impact on haskap (*Lonicera caerulea*), a cold-hardy ornamental shrub grown in Alaska for its early-ripening edible berries. Wild-types of *L. caerulea* are circumpolar in distribution, native to forests of Asia, Europe, and North America^[The taxonomic status of *L. caerulea* is still under debate. Some taxonomists have proposed splitting the North American species apart from *L. caerulea* and into two distinct species&mdash;*L. villosa* in central/eastern North America and *L. cauriana* in western North America [@Fernald1925]. However, genetic and morphological study is yet to produce a widely-accepted global taxonomy [@Petersonetal2018; @HayesPeterson2020]], however, Alaska is not within the native range of this species. The University of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan, Canada) began a haskap breeding program in 2000, creating cultivars of haskap with improved taste and berry size, and is now home to a diverse collection of haskap cultivars including 35 Russian cultivars, over 70 Japanese types, and wild collections from Canada, in addition to thousands of seedlings planted from controlled crosses among their collection [@Bors2008]. Despite the extensive study of haskap through the University of Saskatchewan Fruit Program and production of haskap by the Haskap Canada Association, this plant is largely considered to have few pests in Canada, with reported pests including birds and powdery mildew without mention of defoliating caterpillars [@Bors2008; @HaskapCanadaAssociation2018]. @Ferris2017 mentions leafrollers with a vigorous wiggle found in production haskaps in Yukon, Canada, however, no identification or photo is given to determine whether this may be the honeysuckle moth. Honeysuckle moth larvae were also collected from ornamental Tatarian honeysuckles (*Lonicera tatarica* Linnaeus) in Anchorage in 2022.

Alaska does have a native honeysuckle, the twin honeysuckle (*Lonicera involucrata* (Richardson) Banks ex Spreng.), which could potentially serve as host to the honeysuckle moth if the moth were to spread outside Southcentral Alaska. This native honeysuckle occurs in parts of Southeast Alaska but is not naturally occurring in Anchorage nor the Matanuska-Susitna Valley where the honeysuckle moth has been found [@Bressette2017]. 

## Records & Distribution 

The early records of the honeysuckle moth indicate this species was introduced to North America from Europe in the early 1900s. The earliest records I can find of this species in North America are reported by William T. M. Forbes under the name *Cerostoma xylostella*^[A note of caution when searching the earlier literature, there is a bit of taxonomic confusion involving the name *Cerostoma xylostella* (L.) as this name is also considered a synonym of the diamondback moth, *Plutella xylostella* (L.) [@Alford1971; @Lim1982]. The host plants help to clarify which species a reference pertains to, as *P. xylostella* larvae feed on plants in the family Brassicaceae whereas Forbes’ “honeysuckle leaf-roller” caterpillars were collected from *Lonicera* (Family Caprifoliaceae) [@Forbes1923]. Forbes published several articles using the name *Cerostoma xylostella* to refer to the honeysuckle moth, however know that he uses the name *Plutella maculipennis* Curtis when referring to the diamondback moth [@Forbes1923]. An interesting tidbit about the name is that in 1858, @VanVoorst1858 published a species list of British moths in which he includes name derivations for each species. He attributes the name *Cerostoma xylostella* to refer to the honeysuckle moth, interpreting “*xylostella*” to mean “feeds on honeysuckle” derived from the plant *Lonicera xylosteum*. It is thought that Linnaeus himself got the two species confused at some point in their descriptions [@Harcourt1963] but due to naming priority “*xylostella*” is currently considered to be the valid species name for the diamondback moth [@Lim1982].] Linnaeus (subgenus *Harpipteryx*) which he calls the “honeysuckle leaf-roller”; his reports include adults collected by Frank Haimbach in July 1910 flying near honeysuckle in Massachusetts [@Forbes1923; @Johnson1927] and adults collected in 1924 by Forbes himself in Ithaca, New York, from a trap light [@Forbes1924]. @Forbes1924 refers to this species as a minor pest from Europe. Charles W. @Johnson1927 was interested in the dispersal of this newly introduced species; he reports this species under the name *Harpipteryx xylostella* L. as identified by lepidopterist August Busck and finds additional records of this species from 1919 in both Rhode Island and New Hampshire. Busck describes the honeysuckle moth as “a European species introduced within recent years” [@Johnson1927]. Busck had previously published descriptions and keys to the North American *Cerostoma*-group yponomeutids in 1903, in which *H. xylostella* is mentioned as a European member of the genus but was not known to occur in North America at that time [@Busck1903]. Additional names synonymous with this species include *Alucita dentella* Fabricius, *Tinea harpella* Dennis & Schiffermuller, and *Cerostoma affinitella* Staudinger.

There are two records of the honeysuckle moth in the University of Alaska Museum of the North Arctos database prior to 2022: an adult observed 10 July 1989 ([UAMObs:Ento:97862](<https://arctos.database.museum/guid/UAMObs:Ento:97862>)) and an observation of unspecified life stage from 20 July 1992 ([UAMObs:Ento:35257](<https://arctos.database.museum/guid/UAMObs:Ento:35257>)), both from Anchorage and both listing “*Lonicera* sp.” as the habitat.
