	abstract = {Arthropods are well known to biomineralize and metallize their exoskeletons with naturally occurring elements that function to stabilize the protein component and add hardness to surfaces that endure wear. In this study, we provide the first description of the trace elements in the cuticle of a marine intertidal pseudoscorpion, Halobisium occidentale, using energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. We characterized the trace element composition of six regions on four specimens: the prosoma, opisthosoma, tarsal claws, arolia, chelicerae, and pedipalps. In addition to the elements C, O, and N that make up the α-chitin component of the cuticle, we found 11 trace elements across the body, but only five of these elements were present at significant levels (≥1\% wt): Ni, P, Al, Zn, and Fe. The only trace element on both tagmata is P, while the appendages and their structures contain varying amounts of other elements. The tarsal claws are supplemented with Zn and Ni, while the adhesive arolia contain either Ni or P. The pedipalps are enriched with Al along their proximodistal axis, with P, Zn, and Fe present only around the venom pore. The chelicerae have P, Zn, and Fe present only on the distal regions. This study confirms that pseudoscorpions, like many other arthropods, enrich their cuticle with specific elements at precise locations that are important in predation (cheliceral fingers, pedipalps, venom pore) and locomotion (tarsal claws, arolia). This is also the first study to reveal the presence of Al and Ni in any significant quantities in the arthropod exoskeleton.},

	abstract = {Pseudoscorpions are a diverse lineage of arachnids with a rich history of taxonomic study. However, they remain one of the lesser-known groups of arachnids and many questions about these enigmatic arthropods remain. The present work revises the taxonomy and systematics of the family Neobisiidae in the Southwest, documenting the existence of several new species and a hitherto unknown clade from the Sky Island region of southeastern Arizona. It also describes the venom of a pseudoscorpion for the first time, through comparative transcriptomic studies. Seven new species are described and assigned to the genus Globocreagris, extending the known range of this genus from California into Arizona, Oregon, and Washington. The monophyly of the subfamily Neobisiinae was tested using two genes (COI and 28S). Molecular phylogenetic analysis of both genes and the pattern of trichobothrial placement on the chelae supports removing Parobisium from the subfamily Neobisiinae, and placing it within the subfamily Microcreagrinae, a reassignment here made. Although it has long been known that most pseudoscorpions possess venom glands in their pincers which they use to subdue their arthropod prey, the components of the venom have never been identified. Using comparative transcriptomics from the pedipalps of Globocreagris the first putative venom proteins in pseudoscorpions were identified. Putative venom proteins include astacin-like metalloproteases, chitinases, cysteine-rich secretory proteins, Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors, phospholipase A2, and scorpion La1-like peptides.},
