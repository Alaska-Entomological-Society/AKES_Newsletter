## Introduction

Pseudoscorpions, or false scorpions, are small scorpion-like members of the Class Arachnida, which includes spiders, mites, scorpions, and ticks, among others. They lack the tail-like appendage found on true scorpions and do not bite or sting people or pets. Most pseudoscorpions are less than 8 mm long. Like their cousins, pseudoscorpions have 8 legs. The body is reddish or brown in color and pear-shaped. Extending from the head are 2 long pedipalps, each ending in a pincer that is used to grab prey. Venom in the pedipalps paralyze prey.

Pseudoscorpions can be found on land and the intertidal zone. To avoid contact with water when the tide floods their habitat, marine pseudoscorpions enter silk-lined retreats. Mating and molting (shedding of the exoskeleton) also take place in these retreats.

According to the literature a single pseudoscorpion species lives in the marine intertidal areas in Juneau. It belongs in the family Neobisiidae. Its scientific name is *Halobisium occidentale*. In fact it is the only representative of *Halobisium* in North America. It is known to occur in Alaska, California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia.

It is a fascinating creature and we have been trying to document its behavior and life cycle with photographs. Here is what we have learned so far.


## Where they live

(ref:pseudoscorpions02alt) A folding chair and table in an area where the tide has receded, leaving scattered seaweed and rocks exposed.

(ref:pseudoscorpions02cap) Intertidal habitat where pseudoscorpions have been found under rocks in Tee Harbor, Juneau.

```{r pseudoscorpions02, fig.alt="(ref:pseudoscorpions02alt)", fig.cap="(ref:pseudoscorpions02cap)"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pseudoscorpions02.jpg')
```


(ref:pseudoscorpions03alt) A rocky beach with scattered seaweed. Snow-capped mountains and a patch of conifer trees are visible in the background.

(ref:pseudoscorpions03cap) Some of the intertidal habitat in the Fish Creek Park has numerous pseudoscorpions under the rocks.

```{r pseudoscorpions03, fig.alt="(ref:pseudoscorpions03alt)", fig.cap="(ref:pseudoscorpions03cap)"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pseudoscorpions03.jpg')
```


(ref:pseudoscorpions04alt) Two rocks sitting on a folding table, one of which has barnacles covering one side.

(ref:pseudoscorpions04cap) We usually find them under rocks. The lower portion of the rocks can be buried up to about 6 inches in the sediment.

```{r pseudoscorpions04, fig.alt="(ref:pseudoscorpions04alt)", fig.cap="(ref:pseudoscorpions04cap)"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pseudoscorpions04.jpg')
```


(ref:pseudoscorpions05alt) A pseudoscorpion near the edge of a rock with pedipalps outstretched.

(ref:pseudoscorpions05cap) On the underside of these fairly small rocks we usually see the Pseudoscorpions moving about.

```{r pseudoscorpions05, fig.alt="(ref:pseudoscorpions05alt)", fig.cap="(ref:pseudoscorpions05cap)"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pseudoscorpions05.jpg')
```


(ref:pseudoscorpions06alt) A pseudoscorpion with its front half reaching out from a crevice in a rock.

(ref:pseudoscorpions06cap) We occasionally see them partially in a small hole on the underside of the rock.

```{r pseudoscorpions06, fig.alt="(ref:pseudoscorpions06alt)", fig.cap="(ref:pseudoscorpions06cap)"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pseudoscorpions06.jpg')
```


(ref:pseudoscorpions07alt) The same as figure 6 except the camera is angled toward the face of the pseudoscorpion.

(ref:pseudoscorpions07cap) We occasionally see them partially in a small hole on the underside of the rock (continued).

```{r pseudoscorpions07, fig.alt="(ref:pseudoscorpions07alt)", fig.cap="(ref:pseudoscorpions07cap)"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pseudoscorpions07.jpg')
```


(ref:pseudoscorpions08alt) A large, square rock on top of smaller rocks with sparse patches of seaweed and other vegetation.

(ref:pseudoscorpions08cap) Under the larger rocks we often find them associated with their cocoons. 

```{r pseudoscorpions08, fig.alt="(ref:pseudoscorpions08alt)", fig.cap="(ref:pseudoscorpions08cap)"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pseudoscorpions08.jpg')
```


(ref:pseudoscorpions09alt) The large, square rock from Figure 8 is turned over, revealing the soil below. An arrow labeled "cocoons" is pointing at an area of the soil beneath the rock.

(ref:pseudoscorpions09cap) They typically build these cocoons to overwinter in and mating and molting (shedding of the exoskeleton) also take place in these retreats.

```{r pseudoscorpions09, fig.alt="(ref:pseudoscorpions09alt)", fig.cap="(ref:pseudoscorpions09cap)"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pseudoscorpions09.jpg')
```


(ref:pseudoscorpions10alt) A closeup of the soil from beneath the rock from figures 8 and 9 showing a small, rounded divot.

(ref:pseudoscorpions10cap) Two cocoons attached to the sand under the rock.

```{r pseudoscorpions10, fig.alt="(ref:pseudoscorpions10alt)", fig.cap="(ref:pseudoscorpions10cap)"}

```

```


(ref:pseudoscorpions12alt) A wall of soil and debris forming a circular concretion (cocoon) with an empty center.

(ref:pseudoscorpions12cap) We also see their cocoons attached to the large rocks we have turned over. Probably turning over these rocks causes some to remain attached to the rock and some to the sand. 

```{r pseudoscorpions12, fig.alt="(ref:pseudoscorpions12alt)", fig.cap="(ref:pseudoscorpions12cap)"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pseudoscorpions12.jpg')

```


(ref:pseudoscorpions14alt) A very large rock on a beach with a white arrow pointing at it.

```{r pseudoscorpions15, fig.alt="(ref:pseudoscorpions15alt)", fig.cap="(ref:pseudoscorpions15cap)"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pseudoscorpions15.jpg')
```


(ref:pseudoscorpions16alt) At least a dozen coccoons visible on the substrate where a large rock has been turned over. Plant roots intertwine with the cocoons at the surface.

(ref:pseudoscorpions16cap) This shows numerous cocoons attached to the substrate when we turned over one of the larger rocks at the Fish Creek Park.

```{r pseudoscorpions16, fig.alt="(ref:pseudoscorpions16alt)", fig.cap="(ref:pseudoscorpions16cap)"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pseudoscorpions16.jpg')
```


(ref:pseudoscorpions17alt) A closer view of figure 16 shows the pseudoscorpions nestled inside the cocoons.

## What they eat

According to the literature they feed on these Beach Springtails which we often see on the same rocks as the pseudoscorpions.

```{r pseudoscorpions18, fig.alt="(ref:pseudoscorpions18alt)", fig.cap="(ref:pseudoscorpions18cap)"}
knitr::include_graphics('img/pseudoscorpions18.jpg')
```

For good information about springtails look at <http://www.collembola.org/> These springtails belong to the subfamily Onychiurinae. Some are called Beach Springtails. According to the literature some in this family have no eyes and do not possess a furcula for jumping. The ones without eyes and a furcula were the ones we see on the same rocks. They typically can live under the water for at least four hours. When the tide goes out they emerge under rocks for feeding.

From @Hughes2017: Pseudoscorpions have 3 juvenile instars (termed protonymph, deutonymph and tritonymph) followed by the adult life stage. The lifestage of a typical pseudoscorpion is easily discerned by examining the movablefinger of the pedipalp chelae which will have 1, 2, 3, or 4 trichobothria dependingon if the specimen is a protonymph, deutonymph, tritonymph or adult [@Chamberlin1931]. When pseudoscorpions molt, they use silk from their chelicerate mouthparts to construct small, protective chambers within their confined habitat [@Kew1914]."

## Life Cycle

From @Hodgson2008.

Pseudoscorpions have an extended life cycle of 1 to 3 years, depending on the location and temperature.

The mating ritual for pseudosporpions is similar to the dance of true scorpions. The male pseudoscorpion produces a spermatophore, or sperm packet, and pulls the female over it during the mating dance.

The female carries a silken egg pouch of 12 to 24 eggs on her belly for about 3 weeks.

The hatched brood ride on the females back until they get older.

The young look like the adults except smaller; they will molt three times over several years before becoming adults.

Adults live for 2 to 3 years and females may produce several broods a year.

Pseudoscorpions overwinter in silken cocoons.
